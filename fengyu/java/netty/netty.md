#### Netty
Netty — an asynchronous event-driven network application framework.

The main purpose of Netty is **building high-performance protocol servers based on NIO (or possibly NIO.2) with separation and loose coupling of the network and business logic components**. It might implement a widely known protocol, such as HTTP, or your own specific protocol.
