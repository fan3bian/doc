    }
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (scanner != null) {
        scanner.close();
    }
}
//try-with-resources
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("test.txt"))) {
    while (scanner.hasNext()) {

#### try-with-resources
1.7新增，优化了try-catch语句关闭资源繁冗语句。
resource handled by a try-with-resources block, the class should implement the Closeable or AutoCloseable interfaces, and override the close method


#### try-with-resources With Multiple Resources
先开后关 Resources that were defined/acquired first will be closed last
